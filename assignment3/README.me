The task of the assignment #3 is the design of a CNN architecture and its training.

Input dataset: MNIST digits (input size 28x28x1, number of classes: 10).
The dataset is not distributed since can be easily downloaded directly from Keras.

The CNN has to be designed with the aim of reaching the maximum possible accuracy on the test set, with the hard constraint of a maximum of 7K learnable parameters.
